				 <p>- I developed a technical analysis tool which was implemented in 	a fund network in New York.

				 <p>- I’ve represented my state team in Badminton. </p>

				 <p>- I’ve represented my country in Pool under-19.</p>


				 <p> Now, I’ve created a website, which doesn’t say a whole 
					lot, but it’ll hopefully lead to much better work in future.    </p>
